```

### Authentication & Security

- **JWT-based Auth:** Supabase handles user authentication, issuing JWTs that are stored securely in cookies.
- **Middleware Protection:** All incoming requests are intercepted by `src/middleware.ts`. This middleware:
  - Refreshes user sessions.
  - Redirects unauthenticated users from protected routes to the login page.
  - Enforces strict Content Security Policies (CSP) and other security headers.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Data is protected at the database level using PostgreSQL's RLS, ensuring tenants can only access their own data.
- **Admin Client:** For administrative tasks, a Supabase client with the `service_role_key` is used in secure server-side environments to bypass RLS.

## üé® Design System

The UI is built upon a flexible design system configured in `tailwind.config.js`.

- **CSS Variables:** The entire color palette and styling system (borders, radii) is powered by CSS variables, allowing for dynamic theming.
- **Theming:** Light and dark modes are managed by `next-themes`, configured in the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`). The theme is applied globally by adding a `dark` or `light` class to the `<html>` element.
- **Fonts:** The project uses `Geist Sans` for UI text and `Geist Mono` for code, loaded via `next/font`.
- **Animation:** UI animations are handled with `tailwindcss-animate`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** `v18.17.0` or higher.
- **npm:** `v8.x` or higher.
- **Supabase Account:** Access to the project's Supabase instance.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd cmg-dashboard
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root. The only required variable for local development is the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

```properties
# .env.local
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

You can find this key in your Supabase project settings under `API` > `Project API Keys`.

> **Note:** The Supabase URL and Anon Key are hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`. For production, it's recommended to move these to environment variables.

### 5. Setup Database & Types

The project relies on a pre-existing database schema on Supabase.

‚ö†Ô∏è **No Migrations:** This repository does not contain SQL migration files. For local development, you will need to either:
a) Get a SQL schema dump from the project lead.
b) Connect to a shared development instance of the Supabase database.

Once your database is accessible, generate TypeScript types for full type-safety:

```bash
npm run db:types
```

This script introspects your Supabase schema and generates `src/types/supabase.ts`.

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production build. **Do not use for development.**
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase for errors.
- `npm run test`: Runs all Jest tests.
- `npm run db:types`: Generates TypeScript types from the Supabase schema.

### Coding Standards

- **Follow Existing Patterns:** Adhere to the architecture and patterns established in the codebase.
- **Services for DB Interaction:** All database operations should be encapsulated within service classes in `src/services/`. Avoid direct database calls from components.
- **Error Handling:** Use centralized error handlers and the `AppError` class.
- **Environment Variables:** All secrets and environment-specific configurations must be handled through environment variables.

### Testing

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library. Test files are co-located with their corresponding modules in `__tests__` directories.

- Run all tests with `npm test`.
- Run tests for a specific area (e.g., services) with `npm run test:services`.
