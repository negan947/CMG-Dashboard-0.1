## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack:

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v15) with App Router
- **Database & Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for headless components
- **State Management:** [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for global client-side state
- **Forms:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for validation
- **Charting:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) & [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version `18.17.0` or higher.
- `npm` (comes with Node.js).
- Access to the project's Supabase instance.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd cmg-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required `npm` packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. You only need to add the Supabase Service Role Key, which is used for administrative tasks that bypass Row Level Security (RLS).

```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

**Note:** The Supabase URL and Anon Key are currently hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`. For better security and flexibility, it is recommended to move these to the `.env.local` file as well:

```
# Recommended additions to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 4. Database Setup

The database schema must be set up in your Supabase project.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This repository does not currently contain SQL migration files. The schema is assumed to exist on the Supabase project. Please contact the project lead for the schema SQL dump or for access to a development database.

Once your database is ready, you need to generate the TypeScript types for it. This enables full type safety when interacting with the database.

```bash
npm run db:types
```

This command will populate `src/types/supabase.ts` based on your database schema.

## üèÉ Running the Application

- **Development Server:** To run the app in development mode with hot-reloading:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

- **Testing:** The project is configured with Jest for unit and integration testing.

  ```bash
  npm test # Run all tests
  npm test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
  ```

- **Production Build:** To create a production-ready build of the application:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  **Note:** As per project guidelines, do not use `npm run build` during development. Use `npm run dev` exclusively.

## üìÇ Codebase Overview

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure with some key conventions:

- `src/app/`: Contains all routes, pages, and layouts. The core features are nested under `src/app/dashboard/`.
- `src/components/`: Shared, reusable React components.
- `src/services/`: Houses the business logic for interacting with the Supabase backend. It contains classes like `ProfileService`, `SettingsService`, etc.
- `src/lib/`: Core utilities, helper functions, and configurations.
  - `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`: Handles Supabase client creation on the server.
  - `src/lib/mcp.ts`: Contains a legacy method for making raw SQL queries. New features should prefer using the service layer.
  - `src/lib/schemas/`: Zod schemas for form and data validation.
  - `src/lib/stores/`: Zustand store for global state.
- `src/types/`: Contains TypeScript type definitions, including the auto-generated `supabase.ts`.
